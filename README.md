# Simple To-Do List App with Express Server and MongoDB


This project is a straightforward yet powerful To-Do List application that leverages an Express server and utilizes MongoDB for local data storage. With an easy-to-understand codebase and user-friendly interface, this app demonstrates the integration of backend and database technologies to create a functional task management tool.

## Features
